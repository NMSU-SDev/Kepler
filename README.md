## Avoiding Git conflicts
Before doing any work, enter the following commands to ensure that you have an up-to-date master branch and there are no issues with your branch and the up-to-date master branch. Feel free to ask any questions in the team Discord server if there are any issues when trying to work with Git since it is very likely that Twine will not cooperate with Git fully.

1. `git checkout master`
2. `git pull origin master`
3. `git checkout <branchname>` [assuming you have already created a branch to work in]
4. `git merge master`
5. `git push`
